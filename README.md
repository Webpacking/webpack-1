#Webpack-1

*TODO: [simplified Webpack description or link to slides]*

###*This repo was designed to be a step-by-step, bare-bones intro to the Webpack module bundler. The intended usage goes as follows:*

1. Create a folder that will contain 2-3 projects, this being the first/example

2. Each branch of this repo contains examples and instructions to build your absolute basic Webpack-1 project and convert it to Webpack2

3. It's best to first follow the README instructions of each branch, side-by-side, while building up your project.

4. Most of the files will be fully functional, but as you progress, there are a few intentional 'gotchas' to overcome to help solify your understanding.

###*Some other recommendations to improve your grasp:*
- Delete and rebuild the project after every branch
- Make use of the [Webpack1](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/) documentation for deeper explanations and various usage examples (again, this is intended to be as bare-bones as possible)
- After you complete your Webpack2 migration create a separate project and rebuild from scratch
